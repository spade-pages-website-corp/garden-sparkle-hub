                Calgary Landscape Supplies is a proudly family-owned and operated landscape materials
                supplier serving Calgary and surrounding communities. Built on hard work, local
                knowledge, and honest service, our company was founded to make landscaping projects
                easier, more affordable, and more reliable for both homeowners and professionals.
              </p>

              <p>
                At the heart of the business is Rick Uchacz, whose hands-on experience and deep
                understanding of landscaping materials guide everything we do. Rick knows Calgary's
                soil conditions, climate challenges, and seasonal demands firsthand. That local
                expertise allows us to recommend the right products for the job, whether you're
                refreshing your garden beds, installing new sod, building a patio base, or completing
                a full yard transformation.
              </p>

              <p>
                We supply high-quality soils, mulch, decorative rock, gravel, and other essential
                landscape materials at competitive prices, with convenient ordering and dependable
                delivery. If you don't see what you need, just ask — we'll do our best to source it
                for you.
              </p>

              <p>
                Being family-owned means we care about our reputation in the community. We value
                straightforward communication, fair pricing, and building long-term relationships
                with our customers. When you order from Calgary Landscape Supplies, you're not
                dealing with a large corporation — you're working directly with a local team that
                stands behind every load we deliver.
